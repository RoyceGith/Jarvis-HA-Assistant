ZBRANO v0.12.87 adds Pending, Completed, and Attention indicators to Calendar Reminders, filterable delivery history, and persistent visibility for completed reminders after their appointments pass.

ZBRANO v0.12.86 adds preview-first two-way Google Calendar synchronization through the standard Calendar API. Google events appear in ZBRANO's visual calendar, future ZBRANO appointments can be uploaded, linked cancellations propagate, and local Notification Center or Telegram reminders remain independent. Gmail and Calendar use separate OAuth grants and least-privilege scope sets.

ZBRANO v0.12.76 adds bounded, read-only Home Assistant History and Event Timeline intelligence: Recorder trends, Logbook search, multi-entity correlation, deterministic anomaly summaries, a visual timeline workspace, real diagnostics, and isolated chat routing for approved entities. v0.12.75 compacts the header, navigation, and chat composer to give conversations more space.

ZBRANO v0.12.72 improves natural voice prosody by preserving real punctuation, combining short phrases, and avoiding artificial TTS request boundaries at ordinary spaces while retaining streamed playback and next-segment prefetch.

ZBRANO v0.12.71 adds a dedicated Calendar with conversational appointment creation, upcoming and reminder views, a compact header shortcut, and scheduled Notification Center delivery through configured channels such as Telegram.

ZBRANO v0.12.70 keeps voice playback starting while response text is still streaming and pre-generates the next spoken segment during current playback, removing the multi-second pause between sentence-sized TTS requests.

ZBRANO v0.12.69 routes grinder freeze, reboot, telemetry, and incident prompts exclusively to the local read-only grinder diagnostic tools. It retrieves the stored pre-failure window instead of asking for an export and treats a later manual POWER ON reset as operator-caused when the user identifies it that way.
